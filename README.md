Game Exchange is an app that connects two kinds of people. 
1) People who want to rent their old games for $$$
2) People who want to play the newest games but not have to pay the high prices to own them

Both of these people can be satisfied with Game Exchange, a market place app that connects people who love their video games.

Game Exchange was a project created throughout the course of 1 week by Gavin, Shouko and Nii using Ruby on Rails.
